### Hi there, I'm Berenice ðŸ‘‹

I got my first official training at the [neuefische coding bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/) at the beginning of 2021. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently searching for a job in the front end web development world
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on React - based projects and what to keep on learning!
